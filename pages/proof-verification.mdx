## Verify the proofs

<Steps>

### Install the Reclaim SDK

```bash copy
npm install @reclaimprotocol/reclaim-sdk
```

### Import the Reclaim SDK

```js copy
import { reclaimprotocol } from '@reclaimprotocol/reclaim-sdk';
```

### Create a Reclaim instance

```js copy
const reclaim = new reclaimprotocol.Reclaim();
```

### Verify the proofs

When any user submits Reclaim proof on your server or client, you can verify the correctness of the proofs by calling the `verifyCorrectnessOfProofs` method.

You need to pass the `sessionId` and `proofs` to the method. The `sessionId` is the session id of the user. The `proofs` is the array of proofs submitted by the user.

You get them as part of the request body when the user submits the proofs.

```js copy
const isProofsCorrect = await reclaim.verifyCorrectnessOfProofs(sessionId, proofs);
```

It returns a boolean value. If the proofs are correct, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
