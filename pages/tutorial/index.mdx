# Request Proofs from your users

You can ask your users to provide proofs of their credentials that they own on a web platform (aka Providers).

We have two types of Providers:
- [HTTP Provider](/tutorial/http-provider): Use this provider, if the data resides as is in some HTML element. It allows you to specify the URL of the website you're interacting with, the regex to match on the website and the cookies that need to be checked. 
- [Custom Provider](/tutorial/custom-provider): Use this provider, if the data doesn't exist as is in any HTML element and requires some additional compute, for example counting the number of transactions or summing some values on the page - the logic needs to be embedded in a custom provider.
