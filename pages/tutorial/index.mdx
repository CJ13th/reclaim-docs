# Providers

A Provider refers to a method of obtaining and verifying specific credentials or data from external sources, primarily for the purpose of authentication, validation, or information extraction. Providers allow you to build applications on top of other web applications by facilitating the integration of external data into your platform's ecosystem.

There are two distinct types of Providers available:
- [HTTP Provider](/tutorial/http-provider): Use this provider, if the data resides as is in some HTML element. It allows you to specify the URL of the website you're interacting with, the regex to match on the website and the cookies that need to be checked. 
- [Custom Provider](/tutorial/custom-provider): Use this provider, if the data doesn't exist as is in any HTML element and requires some additional compute, for example counting the number of transactions or summing some values on the page - the logic needs to be embedded in a custom provider.
