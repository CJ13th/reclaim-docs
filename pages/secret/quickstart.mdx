# Quickstart for Solidity
## Pre-requisite
This tutorial assumes that you have a frontend that requests proofs from the user and processes the response, like [React](/react), [React Native](/react-native), or [Node](/node).

We will be using [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) as a wallet to interact with the frontend interface.

If you do not wish to do the whole process of deploying our contract, but you rather would like to directly use it, feel free to skip this page to the [next one](./secret) .
## Secret 
<Steps>
### Deploy the smart contract
Deploy the [smart contract](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-cosmwasm) to Secret.
```bash copy showLineNumbers
git clone https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/reclaim-cosmwasm.git
make secret
# Prepare for deployment
MNEMONIC= 
OWNER= 
# deploy, add epoch, and do a simple verification
node all
```


### Get the artifacts
Once deployed, take a note of the following:
  - Code hash.
  - Contract address.

### Publish on chain
  - [secretjs](./secret).
