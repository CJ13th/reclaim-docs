# React components (Reclaim)
[Reclaim Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reclaimprotocol/react-components?activeTab=readme) is a versatile package designed to simplify the complex implementation of reclaim functionality in your React applications.
This package provides a set of pre-built, simple configuration based React utility components that offer a hassle-free way to handle various aspects of reclaim sdk allowing developers to commence their projects swiftly.
These components abstract away Reclaim-specific codes, presenting straightforward, customizable UI interfaces, enabling developers to concentrate on their core business logic.
It comes with minimal pre-defined styles, developers can effortlessly tailor the components to harmonize with their application's visual identity.

## Components

### GenerateProof
The GenerateProof component is a utility component provided by the [Reclaim Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reclaimprotocol/react-components?activeTab=readme) package.
It simplifies the process of working with the ReclaimSDK by abstracting the creation of a session with a specific app ID and user ID. Additionally, it offers a user-friendly interface that displays a QR code generated from the session link, manages messaging from session creation to proof submission, and includes a built-in progress timer to indicate the remaining time.

#### Usage
To use the GenerateProof component, follow these steps:

<Steps>

#### Import

```tsx
	import { GenerateProof } from '@reclaimprotocol/react-components';
```

#### Render
Include the component in your application's JSX code, providing the necessary props:
```tsx
<GenerateProof
  appID='6d6c04eb-237b-4599-8797-94d48b0ac612'
  userID='dasq2easdase-asdq2e3'
  onProofSubmission={() => {
    // Implement logic for successful proof submission
  }}
  onProofSubmissionFailed={() => {
    // Implement logic for failed proof submission
  }}
/>
```

#### Output
<br />
<GenerateProofUsage />
