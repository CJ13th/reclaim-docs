# Sign Proof Requests
The user should know that the proof is being requested by you and not a phishing website. 
In order to do that, we require all the proof requests to be signed before the user is asked to generate the proofs.

Because of security concerns it is not safe to have the APP_SECRET on the front-end. If it is on the frontend, any malicious user can extract the APP_SECRET and build a phishing website to emulate you.

## Setup a backend endpoint
So, to sign the proof requests, we recommend you setting up a backend endpoint.
This endpoint must take the proof request generated by the frontend sdk, authenticate the user, and respond with a signed URI for the user to open.

```js copy showLineNumbers
import { ReclaimClient } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk'


router.post('/sign', async function(req, res) {
    const requestedProofs = req.body; //TODO@madhavan
    const providerIds = ['provider_id']; //TODO : Update provider IDs based on what you selected while creating the application
    const reclaimClient = new ReclaimClient(APP_ID); //TODO: Update APP_ID with your app id
    reclaimClient.setSignature(
        await reclaimClient.getSignature(
            requestedProofs,
            APP_SECRET //TODO : Update APP_SECRET with your app secret
        ) 
    )
    const reclaimReq = await reclaimClient.createVerificationRequest(providerIds);
    const signedUrl = await reclaimReq.start();
    res.send(signedUrl)
})
```
