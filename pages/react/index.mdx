## Overview

You can use Reclaim SDK directly in your app without needing any backend changes. 
If you want to implement your own authentication mechanism to keep user's data secure - we recommend using the [backend libraries](/node).

However, the React SDK is a great way to get something going quickly. Particularly good for MVPs.

## Flows
### Integrating Reclaim on a Desktop Website
The flow looks like follows
1. User logs in into your website
2. Your website creates a new session for this user using the Reclaim SDK, requesting data from Acme.com; This returns a URI.
3. Your website displays a QR code of the URI, for that particular user's session
4. User scans the QR code using their mobile phone regular camera
5. User is prompted to login into Acme.com on a webview
6. Once user has logged in, a proof is generated on the user's device
7. User hits submit to upload the proof
8. Your website executes business logic basis the proof submitted by the user

### Integrating Reclaim on a Mobile Website
The flow remains pretty much the same. However, we recommend you detect the users' device as desktop or mobile - and make the required tweaks (Particularly, step 3).
1. User logs in into your website
2. Your website creates a new session for this user using the Reclaim SDK, requesting data from Acme.com; This returns a URI.
3. Your website displays a button of the URI, for that particular user's session
4. User taps the button
5. User is prompted to login into Acme.com on a webview
6. Once user has logged in, a proof is generated on the user's device
7. User hits submit to upload the proof
8. Your website executes business logic basis the proof submitted by the user
