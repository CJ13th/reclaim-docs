## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or later

## Quickstart

<Steps>
### Create an application on Dev Tool
Head to https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org and create a new application. You'll be prompted to provide the websites you want to import data from. Once you create the application, you'll be given an `application ID` and an `application secret`. Please take note of these. These will be used in the next steps.

### Install Reclaim SDK
```bash copy
npm i @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

### Import Reclaim Client
```js copy showLineNumbers
import { ReclaimClient } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk'
```

### Initialize Reclaim Client
Boiler plate stuff.
```js copy showLineNumbers
    const reclaimClient = new ReclaimClient("YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE"); //TODO: replace with your applicationId
    const providerIds = ['provider_id']; //TODO: replace with your provider ids you had selected while creating the application
    const providers = await reclaimClient.buildHttpProviderV2ByID(providerIds);
```

### Add Context to the proof, optional but recommended
You can add context to your proof. There are two pieces of information that are part of context.
1. Address - this can be an Ethereum/Solana/Cosmos address. This is typically set when the proof is to be used on a blockchain application. When using on blockchain applications, we recommend setting this context address and using this address in the business logic instead of signer of the transaction (e.g. `msg.sender`). If you don't set the context address and use transaction signer as the user's address, there is a front-running security threat.
2. Message - this can be used to inform the user why this proof is being requested. If your application needs to be sure that the user generates a fresh cryptographic proof for your application, and not reuse an existing proof they created for some other application, you should set the `context.message` to something that is unique to your application. Upon receiving the proof from the user, ensure that the context.message is exactly what you had set it to earlier to avoid scammers from spoofing your users' proofs.

```js copy showLineNumbers
    await reclaimClient.addContext(address=`user's address`, message="for acmecorp.com on 1st january")
```

### Build the Proof Request object
```js copy showLineNumbers
    const requestProofs = reclaimClient.buildRequestedProofs(
      providers,
      reclaimClient.getAppCallbackUrl()
    );

```

### Set Signature for request
You must set a signature on the request so that the users don't get tricked on phishing websites, and mistakenly upload all their data to a malicious website.

For a simple MVP, you can generate the signature on the frontend :
```js copy showLineNumbers
    reclaimClient.setSignature(
        await reclaimClient.getSignature(
        requestProofs,
        APP_SECRET //TODO : replace with your APP_SECRET
      )
    );
```

However, we recommend not generating the signature on the frontend because this leaks the APP_SECRET. You may expose a `/sign` endpoint that authenticates your user and returns a signature.
```js copy showLineNumbers
	reclaimClient.setSignature(
		//TODO: signature response from your backend
	)
```

### Get the request URL

```js copy showLineNumbers
  const reclaimReq = await reclaimClient.createVerificationRequest(providerIds);
  const requestUrl = await reclaimReq.start();
```

### Display the QR code or display a button
If the user opens your website on a laptop, show the QR code of the `requestUrl`.
If the user opens your website on a mobile, show a button that has a link to `requestUrl`.

### Set callbacks
You get a callback when the user uploads the proof
```js copy showLineNumbers
    reclaimReq.on('success', function(proofs) {
		//TODO: your business logic
	});
	reclaimReq.on('error', function(errors) {
		//TODO: your business logic
	})
```
</Steps>


## Summarizing
If you omit all the optional steps, you'd be left with the following codebase : 
```js copy showLineNumbers
    const reclaimClient = new ReclaimClient("APP_ID");
    const providerIds = ['PROVIDER_ID'];
    const APP_SECRET ="APP_SECRET";
    const providers = await reclaimClient.buildHttpProviderV2ByID(
      providerIds
    );
    const requestProofs = reclaimClient.buildRequestedProofs(
      providers,
      reclaimClient.getAppCallbackUrl()
    );
    reclaimClient.setSignature(
        await reclaimClient.getSignature(
        requestProofs,
        APP_SECRET
      )
    );
    const reclaimReq = await reclaimClient.createVerificationRequest(providerIds);
    const requestUrl = await reclaimReq.start();
	reclaimReq.on('success', function(proofs) {
		alert("Success");
	})
    // display requestUrl
```
