# Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK

Welcome to the Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK! This toolkit empowers you to integrate Reclaim's proof verification system into your JavaScript applications, whether you're building for the browser or Node.js servers.

## Overview

Our JavaScript SDK makes it easy to implement this powerful functionality in your projects.

## Quick Start for Beginners

New to Reclaim? Here's how to get started:

1. [Installation](./js/installation)
   Get the SDK set up in your project.

2. [Basic Usage](./js/basic-usage)
   Create your first implementation with a simple example.

## How It Works

Here's a simplified flow of how Reclaim works in a typical web application:

1. **User Login**: A user logs into your website.
2. **Session Creation**: Your site creates a new Reclaim session, generating a unique URI.
3. **Request URL**: Send the user to the reclaim request URL.
4. **User Interaction**: The user visits the request url and logs into the target website (e.g., Acme.com).
5. **Proof Generation**: A proof is created on the user's device.
6. **Proof Submission**: The user submits the proof to your application.
7. **Verification**: Your app verifies the proof and takes appropriate action.

## Choosing Your Implementation

- **Frontend-only**: Perfect for quick prototypes and MVPs. Implement Reclaim directly in your app without backend changes.
- **Backend Integration**: For production apps, we recommend using the backend implementation for enhanced security and custom authentication.
