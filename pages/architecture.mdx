Reclaim Protocol comprises three parts:

### The App: 
The app incorporates an in-app browser with a modified TLS library that enables users to generate zk proofs of exchanged data without disclosing sensitive information.

### The Node:
Nodes maintain the ledger and act as an HTTP proxy, verifying the authenticity of the data exchanged between the user and the website.

### The zk Circuit:
The zk circuit checks whether a regex match is present decrypted data, using the encrypted data (public input), decryption key (private input), and the regex (public input).
