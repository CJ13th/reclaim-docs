# Reclaim Protocol SDKs
<p className='text-blue-300 italic'>Build apps upon user data from around the internet</p>
<br></br>

<p className=''>With Reclaim SDKs, you can leverage cryptographic proofs to get user data from other apps. For example, you can get Uber Diver Ratings, Number of Tinder Matches and many more to build powerful applications or impactful marketing campaigns. </p>
<br></br>
<p>Reclaim Protocol uses ZK Proofs and HTTPS Session Keys to securely retrieve user data. This data is stored only on the userâ€™s device, completely invisible to any server, including those owned by Reclaim. [More details of how the protocol works](https://link.reclaimprotocol.org/whitepaper-draft)</p>
<br/>
<p className=''>Step into the future of data empowerment with Reclaim SDKs and create next-generation applications that redefine user experiences.</p>
