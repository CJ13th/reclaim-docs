# Reclaim Protocol SDKs
<p className='text-blue-300 italic'>Bring users' activity, reputation and identity from other websites into yours, using the easy to use Reclaim SDKs.</p>
<br></br>

<p className=''>
    Reclaim Protocol has SDKs for frontend, backend and on-chain applications. You can leverage these SDKs to build applications that have access to users' activity, reputation, and identity from websites across the internet. 

    For example,
    - Import the number of rides the user has taken on Uber to build a competing ride sharing platform 
    - Import the users' purchasing preferences using Amazon to provide discounts to the right users 
    - Enable economics on a blockchain using users' offchain activity data
    - Use national IDs to perform KYC 
    - And many more...

    We currently support importing data from over 200 websites. If the website you want to import data from isn't on the list, you can build your own data provider using a simple to use [developer tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org).

    The best thing is, we don't need your users to install an app or a chrome extension, unlike many other solutions out there. [Check out our demo!](https://demo.reclaimprotocol.org)

## How does it work?
Reclaim Protocol generates cryptographic proofs on HTTPS traffic. This cryptographic proof, is called a zero knowledge proof. It lets the user generate the proof but leaking zero knowledge of anything other than what the user wants to share with your website. This Protocol builds on open standards such as HTTPS and TLS. The users' data is secured by the strong encryption used by TLS. Also, the protocol employs a blockchain to ensure that no proof can be generated for data that does not exist.

## Is this safe to use?
The users' data is secured by TLS protocol. That means no third party, including Reclaim Protocol or the participating stakeholders (aka attestors) can see the data that is being transferred between the user and the website. You can see our thirdparty [security audits here](https://blog.reclaimprotocol.org/posts/chacha-circuit-audit).
