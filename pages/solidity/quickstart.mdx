# Quickstart for Solidity
## Pre-requisite
This tutorial assumes that you have a frontend that requests proofs from the user and processes the response, like [React](/react), [React Native](/react-native), or [Node](/node).

## Solidity 
<Steps>
### Deploy a smart contract
Deploy the following smart contract to the chain of your choice, we will be using Polygon's Mumbai for this walkthrough.
```js copy showLineNumbers
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;
 
 
import "@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk/contracts/Reclaim.sol";
import "@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk/contracts/Addresses.sol";
 
 
contract Attestor {
   address public reclaimAddress;
   // add providersHashes for your permitted providers
   string[] public providersHashes;

   constructor(string[] memory _providersHashes){
      providersHashes = _providersHashes;
        // TODO: Replace with network you are deploying on
      reclaimAddress = Addresses.PLOYGON_MUMBAI_TESTNET; 
 
   }  
 
   function verifyProof(Reclaim.Proof memory proof) public view{
       Reclaim(reclaimAddress).verifyProof(proof, providersHashes);
       // TODO: your business logic upon success
       // verify proof.context is what you expect
   }
}
```

You can check out the [supported networks here](https://github.com/reclaimprotocol/demo-solidity-sdk/blob/main/contracts/Addresses.sol)

### Get the artifacts
Once deployed, take a note of the following:
  - ChainId (80001 in our case).
  - Contract address.
  - ABI.

### Publish on chain
  - [wagmi.js](./wagmi).
  - [ethers.js]().
