# Quickstart for Solidity
## Pre-requisite
This tutorial assumes that you have a frontend that requests proofs from the user and processes the response, like [React](/js/frontend), [React Native](/react-native), or [Node](/js/backend).

## Solidity 
<Steps>
### Deploy a smart contract
Deploy the following smart contract to the chain of your choice, we will be using Polygon's Mumbai for this walkthrough.
```solidity copy showLineNumbers
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;
 
 
import "@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk/contracts/Reclaim.sol";
import "@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk/contracts/Addresses.sol";
 
 
contract Attestor {
   address public reclaimAddress;
   // add providersHashes for your permitted providers
   string[] public providersHashes;

   constructor(string[] memory _providersHashes){
      providersHashes = _providersHashes;
        // TODO: Replace with network you are deploying on
      reclaimAddress = Addresses.PLOYGON_MUMBAI_TESTNET; 
 
   }  
 
   function verifyProof(Reclaim.Proof memory proof) public view{
       Reclaim(reclaimAddress).verifyProof(proof);
       // TODO: your business logic upon success
       // verify proof.context is what you expect
   }
}
```

### Context Field
`proof.claimInfo.context` is the field were you can add a message and an address to the proof.
In addition, context will be having provider extracted data (e.g. your SteamId if you're using SteamId Provider).
As context is a ``string``, we provide a function that will make it easier for you to extract fields from it:

```solidity copy
function extractFieldFromContext(string memory data, string memory target)
public pure returns (string memory)
  ```
where ``data`` is the context field string and ``target`` is name of the field you want to extract.
<Callout type='warning'>
  Please note that you will need to provider target string in the following format: '"FIELD_NAME_HERE":"' (e.g. '"SteamId":"')
</Callout>
<Callout type='info'>
  you can also use `extractFieldFromContext` to extract `contextAddress` and `contextMessage` using the same mentioned way. 
</Callout>
### Get the artifacts
Once deployed, take a note of the following:
  - ChainId (80001 in our case).
  - Contract address.
  - ABI.

### Publish on chain
  - [wagmi.js](./wagmi).
  - [ethers.js]().
