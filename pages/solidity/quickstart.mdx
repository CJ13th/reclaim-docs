# Quickstart for Solidity
## Pre-requisite
This tutorial assumes that you have a frontend that requests proofs from the user and processes the response.

## Solidity 
<Steps>
### Serialize the proof
```
TODO@madhavan
reclaimClient.serializeProofs(proofs);
```

### Deploy a smart contract
```
TODO@madhavan : smart contract code
```

You can check out the [supported networks here](./supported-networks)

### Extract context address
This is extremely important. Please do not use `msg.sender` as the user who created the proof. Explicitly extract the address from the context.

```
TODO@madhavan : extract context and provider ids from proof on solidity
```

### Send transaction to smart contract
```
TODO@madhavan : Use ethers.js to send serialized proof to the smart contract
```
