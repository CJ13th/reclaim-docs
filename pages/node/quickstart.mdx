# Quickstart
<Callout type='info'>
The following tutorial is based on node express backend
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Install Reclaim SDK
```bash copy
npm i @reclaimprotocol/reclaim-sdk
```

### Import the SDK and initialise it
```js copy showLineNumbers
import { reclaimprotocol } from '@reclaimprotocol/reclaim-sdk';

const reclaim = new reclaimprotocol.Reclaim();
```

### Request proofs from the user
Create an endpoint on your backend server to request proofs from your user
- `callbackId` is optional. If you want to use your own unique identifier for this request instead of reclaim's generated one, you can pass it here
- `contextMessage` is optional. You can pass a message here to let your users know why you are requesting this proof
- `contextAddress` is optional. If you are planning to use this proof for NFT or Coin drops, you can pass your users' EVM/Solana/Bitcoin wallet address here

```js copy {2} showLineNumbers
app.get("/request-proofs", async(req, res) => {
    const request = reclaim.requestProofs({
        title: "My DeFi app", // Name of your application
        baseCallbackUrl: "http://<YOUR_BACKEND_SERVER_URL>/callback", 
        callbackId: "<UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER_GOES_HERE>" // optional
        contextMessage: "Airdrop for Reclaim Users!", //optional
        contextAddress: userAddress, //optional
        requestedProofs: [
            new reclaim.CustomProvider({
                provider: 'bybit-balance',
                payload: {}
            }),
        ],
    });

    const { callbackId } = request;
    const reclaimUrl = await request.getReclaimUrl({});
    // Store the callback Id and Reclaim URL in your database
    // ...
    res.json({ reclaimUrl }); // display this reclaimUrl as a QR code on laptop or as a link on mobile devices for users to initiate creating proofs
}
```

### Handle proof submission
Define callback endpoint to handle proof submission
- Use `reclaim.verifyCorrectnessOfProofs(callbackId, proofs)` to verify if the proofs submitted were correct.
- It returns a boolean value depending on if the proofs were correct or not
- If the proofs were correct, you can use them to perform your business logic
- If the proofs were not correct, you can handle the error accordingly

```js copy {12} showLineNumbers
app.use(express.text({ type: "*/*" }));

app.post("/callback", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Retrieve the callback ID from the URL parameters
    const callbackId = req.query.callbackId as string;

    // Retrieve the proofs from the request body
    const proofs = reclaimprotocol.utils.getProofsFromRequestBody(req.body)

    // Verify the correctness of the proofs (optional but recommended)
    const isProofsCorrect = await reclaim.verifyCorrectnessOfProofs(callbackId, proofs);

    if (isProofsCorrect) {
      // Proofs are correct, handle them as needed
      // ... business logic goes here

      // Respond with a success message
      res.json({ success: true });
    } else {
      // Proofs are not correct or verification failed
      // ... handle the error accordingly

      // Respond with an error message
      res.status(400).json({ error: "Proofs verification failed" });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing callback:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to process callback" });
  }
});
```
