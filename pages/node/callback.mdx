# Building your own callback URL 
By default, the sdk returns an `AppCallbackUrl` as an endpoint provided by Reclaim Protocol.
In some situations, you might want the proofs to be uploaded to your backend once the user creates it. 
Particularly if you want to process the proofs in the backend and take some actions.

## Expose a POST endpoint
The path should contain a session id as a query param.
```js copy showLineNumbers {2}
app.post('/callback/', async (req, res) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.callbackId;
})
```

## Parse the uploaded blob
``` js copy showLineNumbers {3}
app.post('/callback/', async (req, res) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.callbackId;
  const proofs = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(req.body));
})
```

## Verify the proofs
The proofs must be verified to make sure the requested proof matches the proofs created
```js showLineNumbers
  //TODO@madhavan : 
  // reclaimClient.verifyProofs(...)
```

## Verify the metadata
```js showLineNumbers
    //TODO@madhavan : extract context & requested proofs
```
