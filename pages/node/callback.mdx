# Building your own callback URL (WIP)
We recommend setting up your own callback URL. 
Reclaim SDK does provide a default callback for your convenience and deletes the users' data after a timeout. However, if your application uses sensitive user information and cannot afford for that data to be seen by any third party - including Reclaim Protocol & its employees - you must host your own callback.

Here is a guide on how to do that.

## Expose a POST endpoint
The path should contain a session id as a path param.
```js showLineNumbers

router.post("/path/:session_id", async function(req, res){
    const sessionId = req.params.session_id;
    //...
})

```

## Parse the uploaded blob
``` js showLineNumbers
  const proofs = req.body; //use a json middleware
```

## Verify the proofs
```js showLineNumbers
  //TODO@madhavan : 
  // reclaimClient.verifyProofs(...)
```

## Verify the metadata
```js showLineNumbers
    //TODO@madhavan : extract context & requested proofs
```
