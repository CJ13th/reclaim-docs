## Overview

This SDK is designed for integrating the Reclaim Protocol into the backend of your website. 

If you want your website to be compatible with both laptops and mobile devices, we recommend using an if-else condition to render the appropriate flow, as described below.

### Integrating Reclaim on a Desktop Website
The flow looks like follows
1. **User Login**: The user signs into your website.
2. **Session Creation**: Your backend uses the Reclaim Node SDK to initiate a session for the user. In this session, the user is expected to generate a proof of their identity/reputation from a certain website - say, acme.com. This session is identified by a URI.
3. **Display QR Code**: Your website frontend shows a QR code linked to the session-specific URI returned in the previous step.
4. **QR Code Scan**: The user scans the QR code with their mobile phone's regular camera.
5. **Login to Acme.com**: The user is prompted to log into Acme.com via a webview.
6. **Proof Generation**: Once user has logged in, a proof is generated on the user's device.
7. **Proof Submission**: User hits submit to upload the proof back to your backend.
8. **Business Logic**: Your backend processes the proof to execute relevant business operations.


### Integrating Reclaim on a Mobile Website
The integration process for mobile websites mirrors the desktop version with minor adjustments, particularly in how the URI is presented:

1. Step 1 and step 2 remain the same as above. For step 3, detect the user's device type (desktop or mobile) to adjust the user flow accordingly.
2. Instead of displaying a QR code, present a button linked to the session-specific URI.
3. The user taps the button to proceed, following steps 5 through 8 as outlined above.
