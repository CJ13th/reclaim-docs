## Overview

This is the SDK for using Reclaim Protocol on you backend for your website.
If you are integrating on an App, we recommend using the Frontend SDK like the [React Native](/react-native) or [Flutter](/flutter).

If you support your website to be used on both Laptops and Mobiles, we recommend you use an if-else condition to render the appropriate flow as described below.

### Integrating Reclaim on a Desktop Website
The flow looks like follows
1. User logs in into your website
2. Your website backend creates a new session for this user using the Reclaim Node SDK, requesting data from Acme.com; This returns a URI.
3. Your website frontend displays a QR code of the URI, for that particular user's session
4. User scans the QR code using their mobile phone regular camera
5. User is prompted to login into Acme.com on a webview
6. Once user has logged in, a proof is generated on the user's device
7. User hits submit to upload the proof back to your backend
8. Your website executes business logic basis the proof submitted by the user

### Integrating Reclaim on a Mobile Website
The flow remains pretty much the same. However, we recommend you detect the users' device as desktop or mobile - and make the required tweaks (Particularly, step 3).
1. User logs in into your website
2. Your website backend creates a new session for this user using the Reclaim Node SDK, requesting data from Acme.com; This returns a URI.
3. Your website frontend displays a button of the URI, for that particular user's session
4. User taps the button
5. User is prompted to login into Acme.com on a webview
6. Once user has logged in, a proof is generated on the user's device
7. User hits submit to upload the proof back to your backend
8. Your website executes business logic basis the proof submitted by the user
