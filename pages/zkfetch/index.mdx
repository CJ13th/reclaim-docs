# zkFetch
_fetch, but with a zkproof_

zkFetch allows you to securely fetch remote resources over HTTPS endpoints, providing a proof of correct execution that can be verified by third parties. This ensures that sensitive operations, such as using private API keys, are performed correctly without exposing confidential information.

## Overview

You can integrate Reclaim into your backend using zkFetch SDK

### Flows

#### Integrating zkFetch 

The workflow is as follows:

1. **User Initiates Fetch:** The user triggers a fetch request through your backend
2. **Add Required Headers:** adds necessary headers, such as authentication tokens or API keys, to the fetch request if required
3. **Fetch and Generate Proof:** zkFetch performs the fetch operation and generates a proof of correct execution.


## When to Use zkFetch

zkFetch is recommended for fetching public data where the integrity and authenticity of the data need to be verified without exposing any sensitive information. Use zkFetch in scenarios such as:

- Ideal when data is publicly available
- Perfect when you have the auth token and endpoint
