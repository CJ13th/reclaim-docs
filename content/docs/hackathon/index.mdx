*If you are building on Reclaim Protocol as part of your hackathon project, you are qualified to submit and be eligible for the following prize.*

### Prize

Any new application that integrates Reclaim Protocol or ZKFetch to access verified data from any website. 

Following the initial prize, projects will be eligible for **retrospective grants** based on the number of verifications achieved. These grants will reward the real-world impact and adoption of the application over time.

### Judging Criteria

- **Uniqueness of Solution:** Products/Ideas that are possible specifically because of Reclaim will be prioritized. When asked, "How would I have created the same solution without Reclaim?" the answer should be "It wouldn't have been possible."
- **Functionality:** Teams with end-to-end working prototypes and demos will be prioritized.

### Eligibility Criteria

- Participants of hackathons that are already hosted by, or that include prizes offered by, Reclaim Protocol are not eligible.
- Projects must be submitted within 14 days of original hackathon deadline.
- Project code must be open source.
- Full Hackathon Terms of Service are available [here](https://www.notion.so/187275b816cb80eabb7ffacf7f2eccff?pvs=21).
