# Decentralizing Reclaim

Expanding the Reclaim protocol with multi-attestor verification, economic incentives, and anonymity.

## Multi-Attestor Verification Mechanism

* **Problem:** Relying on a single Attestor creates a single point of failure and trust.
* **Solution:** Implement a system where each Claim is verified by multiple independent Attestors.
* **Benefit:** Significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent claims by requiring consensus among multiple parties.

## Economic Incentives and Penalty Mechanisms

* **Problem:** Ensuring Attestor honesty requires more than just trust.
* **Solution:** Introduce economic incentives and penalty mechanisms through:
    * **Token Staking:** Attestors stake tokens as collateral, which can be slashed for dishonest behavior.
    * **Transaction Fees:** Attestors earn fees for verifying Claims, incentivizing participation.
    * **Penalty Mechanisms:** Automated detection and punishment of anomalous behavior.
* **Benefit:** Creates a self-regulating system that promotes honest participation and discourages malicious actions.

## Ensuring Anonymity

* **Problem:** Linking multiple credentials of a user can compromise their privacy.
* **Solution:** Implement measures to guarantee that user credentials remain unlinked, preventing third parties from inferring identities through on-chain data.
* **Benefit:** Protects user privacy and prevents unauthorized tracking of their activity.

## Key Decentralization Goals

* **Enhanced Security:** Multi-attestor verification strengthens the reliability of Claims.
* **Increased Trust:** Economic incentives and penalties foster a trustworthy ecosystem.
* **Improved Privacy:** Anonymity measures safeguard user data.

By implementing these decentralization strategies, we are building a more robust, secure, and private Reclaim protocol, capable of scaling and serving a wider range of use cases.

## The Reclaim Solution: Secure API Attestation

The Reclaim protocol introduces a novel approach using "attestor" nodes to proxy API requests, enabling verifiable data claims.

### How It Works

1.  **Proxied API Request:**
    * The user initiates an API request to a service, routed through an attestor node.
    * The attestor observes the traffic flow.
2.  **Sensitive Data Protection:**
    * The protocol allows users to conceal sensitive data, such as passwords or API secrets (e.g., `{secret-token}`), from the attestor.
3.  **Response Verification:**
    * The attestor verifies that the response from the service (e.g., Google's servers) matches the user's claimed response.
4.  **Signed Claim:**
    * Upon successful verification, the attestor signs a "claim" attesting to the user's access to the specified data (e.g., the email address).
5.  **Trustless Proof:**
    * This signed claim serves as verifiable proof of data access, without revealing the user's sensitive information.


### Trust and Decentralization

While the protocol requires trusting the attestor, this risk is mitigated through decentralization. By establishing a decentralized attestor network, the protocol reduces the potential for collusion and enhances overall security.

## Key Benefits

* **Privacy:** Sensitive information remains protected.
* **Verifiability:** Claims are cryptographically signed and verifiable.
* **Trustlessness:** Enables secure data utilization in trustless environments.
* **Decentralization:** Mitigates risks associated with centralized attestors.
