# Reclaim Protocol: Decentralized Architecture and Incentives

The Reclaim protocol's decentralized architecture relies on smart contracts and a network of Attestor nodes to ensure secure and trustless data verification.

## Core Smart Contracts

* **Task Contract:**
    * Responsible for creating Claim Tasks and achieving Claim consensus.
* **Governance Contract:**
    * Manages Attestor nodes, providing staking, rewards, and penalty mechanisms.
    * Optionally, collects staked $MOCA tokens from Attestors and distributes earnings based on staking ratios and service quality.

## Attestor Registration & Staking

* Attestors must stake a minimum number of $MOCA tokens in the Governance Contract.
* Rewards are distributed based on the staking ratio.
* Attestors must maintain online availability.

## Decentralized Proof of Possession (PoP)

1.  **Claim Task Request:**
    * The user submits a "create claim task" request to the Task Contract via the Reclaim SDK.
2.  **Attestor Selection:**
    * The Task Contract randomly selects Attestors and returns them to the SDK.
3.  **zkTLS Protocol Execution:**
    * The Reclaim SDK establishes connections with the selected Attestors to execute the zkTLS protocol.
4.  **Proof Submission:**
    * Each Attestor returns a Proof to the SDK and submits it to the Task Contract.
5.  **Proof Consensus:**
    * The Task Contract achieves Proof consensus based on the 51% rule.
6.  **Final Proof Packaging:**
    * The SDK packages all Proofs and submits the final Proof to the Task Contract.
7.  **Proof Verification and Storage:**
    * The Task Contract verifies the Proof and stores the result upon successful validation.

## Unstaking

* Upon an unstaking request, the system initiates an undelegation process with a chain-defined unbonding period (e.g., 21 days).
* After the unbonding period, the remaining $MOCA tokens are calculated and returned to the Attestorâ€™s account, accounting for potential slashing risks.
