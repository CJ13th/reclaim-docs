## Understanding how the WebSDKs workflow

### Steps involved
1. A verification link is created on the frontend and displayed for the user to tap/scan QR code.
2. The user opens the above verification link and completes the verification using the Reclaim Protocol [AppClip](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/)/[InstantApp](https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant). The verification must be done using a mobile phone. No app install is required.
3. Once the user completes the verification on the AppClip/InstantApp, they will be prompted to redirect back to your webapp
4. The webapp polls the status of the verification and continues business logic, once the verification has been marked as complete.

### What you need to implement
1. [Frontend](./frontend) application using React
2. [Backend](./backend) application to process the verification securely
