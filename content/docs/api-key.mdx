For being able to use Reclaim Protocol, you need to have 3 variables handy.

## 0. Register
First, head to the [Reclaim Protocol Dev Tool](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org). 
Create an account here if you haven't already.

## 1. Create an Application
Head to [My Applicatons](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/my-applications) from the left navigation bar. Here, tap on [Create Application](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/application-creation).

Provide the application name, description and upload a logo.
This is the information that will be presented to the user when they are generating the proof, to maintain continuity with your brand.

### Copy your Application ID and secret
Once you create the application, you will be shown the Application ID and Application Secret. 
Be sure to copy them into your `.env` file immediately. 

<Callout type="warning">
    You will not be able to see the Application Secret once you leave this screen.
</Callout>

## 2. Add providers
Once you have created the application, you will have to add providers that are supported by this application. You will NOT be able to generate proofs for providers that are not already added to your application.

Open your application `https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/my-applications/[YOUR APP_ID]`

Here you can tap on `Add Provider`

Search for the providers you want to add and click on it to add it to the list.
Once you have added all your providers, hit Update Providers. 

After adding the providers, you can copy the `provider ID` and keep them handy.

## 3. Integrate your SDK
Now, you can head over to the integration guide for your platform - where you can paste these values to get the application up and running!
