## Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- Node.js version 14.x or later (LTS version recommended)
- npm version 6.x or later (included with Node.js) or yarn version 1.22.x or later
- A project directory initialized with `package.json`

To verify your installations:
```bash
node --version
npm --version # or yarn --version
```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the SDK

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal:
```bash
cd your-project-directory
```

Choose one of the following commands based on your package manager:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

### 2. Verify Installation

Confirm the installation by:

1. Checking your `package.json` dependencies:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk": "^x.x.x"  // Version number will vary
  }
}
```

2. Ensuring the SDK files are in your `node_modules` directory

### 3. Using the SDK

Import the SDK into your application using either ES modules or CommonJS syntax:

```javascript
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk';
```

For CommonJS environments:
```javascript
const { ReclaimProofRequest } = require('@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk');
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter installation issues:

- Ensure your Node.js and npm versions are compatible and follow the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section
- Clear your package manager's cache by running `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean` and try reinstalling
