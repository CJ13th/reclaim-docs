**Security Risks of Using Third-Party Providers with JS Injections**

When using providers that include JavaScript injections, especially those created by third parties, it's important to be cautious about security. Here are the key risks to be aware of:

**Risk of Malicious Code**

JavaScript injections have full access to the webpage's DOM and can:

- Read sensitive information (passwords, tokens, personal data)
- Send data to external servers
- Modify page content and behavior
- Access browser storage (cookies, localStorage)

**Best Practices**

- Always review the injection code before using a third-party provider
- Never paste JavaScript code from untrusted sources
- Verify the provider's reputation and source
- Test the provider in a safe environment before using in production

> **Warning**: While we review providers before publishing, you should always verify the code yourself when using community-built providers with JS injections. Your application's security is your responsibility.
