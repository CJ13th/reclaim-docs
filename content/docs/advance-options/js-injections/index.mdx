## What are JS Injections?

When you hear the word "injection," you might think, "Wait, is this some kind of attack?" or "What's going on here?" But actually, injections in the world of JavaScript are far from being anything harmful. They're just simple code snippets that help with tasks we deal with every day like manipulating the DOM or making network calls. So, there's no need to worry. In fact, injections are just another tool that makes our provider more efficient.

## Important Note

**Injections in providers are subject to Admin approval. The provider will be reviewed and approved before it can be published. Only after approval will it become available for use.**

**We will discuss potential security risks associated with using providers that include injections in the Advanced Section**

## When to Use JS Injections

### 1. Programmatic Navigation

If you want to navigate to the proof generation page automatically so users don't have to click around and do it manually. This is a great use for a JS injection.

### 2. Handling Large Payloads

If you're dealing with a large payload and need to include it as part of your proof, this is where injections come in handy. For example:

- Handling paginated responses
- Retrieving all orders from the last 3 months
- Pulling a user's complete ride history

When building a provider, injections allow you to add powerful interactivity and automation capabilities. They serve two main purposes:

1. **Automating User Navigation**: Injections can handle page navigation automatically, eliminating the need for users to click through multiple pages manually. This creates a smoother, more streamlined experience.

2. **Capturing Page Data**: They can automatically collect and include public data present on web pages into your proof, making data gathering more efficient.

These capabilities are especially valuable when dealing with complex workflows or when you need to gather data from multiple sources on a website.
