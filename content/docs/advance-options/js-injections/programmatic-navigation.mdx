# Programmatic Navigation

## Overview

Programmatic navigation uses DOM manipulation to automate user interactions on web pages. In Reclaim, this is particularly important for proof generation - the API needs specific data that can only be accessed on certain pages.

### Why Use Programmatic Navigation?

When generating proofs, the API response must match specific key pointers defined during provider creation. For example, with a Twitter username proof:

- The user must reach their profile page
- Twitter's API needs to fetch the profile information

## Implementation Example

Here's a code snippet that automatically navigates to a user's Twitter profile:

```js
const pageCheck = () => {
  // Check if on Twitter home page
  if (
    window.location.href?.includes('https://x.com/home') ||
    window.location.href?.includes('https://twitter.com/home')
  ) {
    // Click profile icon to open menu
    document.querySelector('button[data-testid="DashButton_ProfileIcon_Link"]').click();

    // Wait briefly, then click profile link
    setTimeout(() => {
      document.querySelector('a.css-175oi2r.r-16y2uox.r-dnmrzs.r-o7ynqc.r-6416eg.r-1ny4l3l.r-1loqt21').click();
    }, 200);
  }
};

// Check URL every 500ms
setInterval(pageCheck, 500);
```

You can test this by pasting it into your browser console (works for mobile view).

## Code Breakdown

1. **pageCheck Function**

   - Checks current URL
   - Automates navigation to profile page
   - Simulates necessary click events

2. **URL Verification**

   - Checks for both `twitter.com/home` and `x.com/home`
   - Uses optional chaining for safety

3. **Click Simulation**

   - First click: Opens profile menu
   - Second click: Navigates to profile page
   - 200ms delay between clicks ensures proper loading

4. **Continuous Checking**
   - Runs every 500ms
   - Ensures navigation happens as soon as possible

## Important Considerations

⚠️ **Warning**: This approach is sensitive to DOM changes. Twitter's HTML structure may update, potentially breaking the selectors. Regular maintenance is required to ensure continued functionality.

**Alternative Approaches**:

- XPath selectors
- Different timing intervals
- Custom event listeners

The core concept remains the same: using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and automate navigation.

## Finding DOM Elements

### Using Browser Developer Tools

1. **Open Developer Tools**

   - Right-click on the element you want to target
   - Select "Inspect Element" (or press F12)
   - The element will be highlighted in the Elements panel

2. **Finding Unique Selectors**
   - Right-click on the highlighted element in the Elements panel
   - Select "Copy" and then choose:
     - "Copy selector" for CSS selectors
     - "Copy XPath" for XPath selectors

### Best Practices for Selecting Elements

```js
// ✅ Good: Using data-testid (most stable)
document.querySelector('[data-testid="profile-button"]');

// ✅ Good: Using specific IDs
document.getElementById('profile-link');

// ⚠️ Caution: Using classes (may change frequently)
document.querySelector('.profile-button-class');

// ❌ Avoid: Complex CSS selectors (very fragile)
document.querySelector('div > span.menu-item:nth-child(2)');
```

### Tips for Reliable Selectors

- Look for `data-testid` attributes first - these are typically stable
- Use IDs when available - they're unique and reliable
- Avoid relying on class names alone - they often change with styling updates
- Test your selectors across different states (logged in/out, different themes)
- Consider mobile vs desktop layouts when selecting elements
