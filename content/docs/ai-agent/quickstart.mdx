# Verification AI Agent Quickstart

The Verification AI Agent is already deployed and ready to use through host AI agents that implement the A2A protocol. No setup is required to use the verification functionality.

The Verification AI Agent is deployed on the following url:

```
https://agent.reclaimprotocol.org/
```

## Host Agent Integration

1. Clone the [Host CLI Agent](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main/samples/python/hosts/cli)
2. Run the CLI Agent:
```bash
uv run hosts/cli --agent https://agent.reclaimprotocol.org
```

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ Note: Push notifications are not enabled by default on the client. You need to set `use_push_notifications=True` and configure a push notification receiver server `push_notification_receiver=<your-push-notification-receiver-server-url>` in your client code to receive all push notifications on the client side.
</Callout>
```bash
uv run hosts/cli --agent https://agent.reclaimprotocol.org --use_push_notifications True --push_notification_receiver <your-push-notification-receiver-server-url>
```

## Using the Verification Agent

1. In the CLI Host Agent, request verification by providing:
   - Email address
   - Field to verify (e.g., "employment", "education")

   Example:
   ```
   - send verification email to user@example.com for Github username verification
   - send verification email to user@example.com for employment verification
   ```

2. The Verification Agent will process your request and send a verification email to the provided email address.

3. The host agent can check the status of the verification request using either the email or name of the verifying user or get real time updates using push notifications

## Supported Features
- Sending verification emails
- Checking verification status
- Push notification support for status updates
