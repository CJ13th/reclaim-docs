### Overview

The Verification AI Agent is a powerful tool that handles email verification for employment, education, and other verification purposes. This agent integrates with the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, allowing it to communicate with host AI agents and provide a seamless verification experience.

### Key Features

- **A2A Protocol Integration**: Seamlessly communicates with host AI agents
- **Remote Verification**: Processes verification requests through natural language queries
- **Push Notifications**: Provides real-time status updates on the verification requests and sends a push notification to the host agent
- **Dynamic Verification Support**: Identifies and supports various verification types (employment, education, social, etc.) based on user queries

### How it works

Verification AI Agent processes verification requests through the A2A protocol:

1. It sends email containing verification links to the specified address

2. Returns verification results to the host agent once the verification is complete in real-time using push notifications

3. The host agent can also check the status of the verification request using either the email or name of the verifying user

### Supported Tools

The Verification AI Agent provides these tools for seamless integration:

#### Send Verification Email
- Sends a verification email to the specified address with a secure verification link. Required fields are `email` and `verification_field`.
- In the below example, the host agent is sending a verification email to the user with the email `joe@gmail.com` and the verification field is `github username`.
