## Verification AI Agent

### Overview

The Verification AI Agent is a powerful tool that handles email verification for employment, education, and other verification purposes. This agent integrates with the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, allowing it to communicate with host AI agents and provide a seamless verification experience.

### Key Features

- **A2A Protocol Integration**: Seamlessly communicates with host AI agents
- **Remote Verification**: Processes verification requests through natural language queries
- **Push Notifications**: Provides real-time status updates on the verification requests
- **Dynamic Verification Support**: Identifies and supports various verification types (employment, education, social, etc.) based on user queries

### How it works

Verification AI Agent processes verification requests through the A2A protocol:

1. It sends email containing verification links to the specified address

2. Returns verification results to the host agent once the verification is complete in real-time using push notifications

3. The host agent can also check the status of the verification request using either the email or name of the verifying user

The agent provides several custom tools that can be called by host agents:

- **send_verification_email**: Send verification email to a user
- **check_verification_status_by_email**: Check verification status by email
- **check_verification_status_by_name**: Check verification status by name
- **push_notification_support**: Support push notifications for status updates to avoid polling
